Below are the review comments

1. browser setup is done in all test classes which is not necessary
2. objects are written in the test class itself which will reduce the reusability/readability/maintainability
3. page object classes should have added
4. objects are defined using pagefactory concepts but the pagefactory is not initialized anywhere
5. No framework methods used
6. No loggers/reporting added
7. Drivers/ dependencies are not updated one


What have i done ?
1. Added pageobject classes
2. Added all the objects and actions to the corresponding pageobject class
3. Initialized pagefactory in MasterPageObject class and used inheritance
4. Created separate drivermanager class to initialize the browser
5. Created a sample framework which supports the logs,html logs, extent html report
6. Added all the require driver actions in DriverUtilities
7. Added MasterTest.java which is a parent for all the tests and is the entry point
8. Updated pom.xml file with latest jars
9. Created a xml testsuite with all the tests (RegressionSuite.xml)
10. Added the xml test suite to pom.xml to run via pom.xml

Find the logs in logs folder
Find the report in reports folder

kindly get back to me if you were expecting an alternative way.
